Hi, [I'm  Darlington](https://blissful-shannon-adedea.netlify.app/), a passionate full-stack developer in Germany. Just like art, where an artist would create wonderful arts with just a pencil and a piece of paper, so is programming. I can create wonderful and valuable tools that could potentially affect the lives of millions - positively - with just a computer, and a cup of koffee. To me, this is amazing! 


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a task management tool - [Taski](https://github.com/Dalin01/taski) - using React, Typescript, PostgreSQL and Express. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about React Native, code testing, & dancing!! ðŸ˜„.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the MERN Stack, some Typescript, Java & Python.
- ðŸ“« How & when to reach me: I am available 24/7 on my [email](somtodarlington@yahoo.com), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darlington-onwuama/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Somtodarlington). 
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him/his
- âš¡ Fun fact: I am an artist, turned Engineer, turned Developer.
