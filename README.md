### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ , 
[linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/darlington-onwuama/)


Hi, [I'm  Darlington](https://blissful-shannon-adedea.netlify.app/), a passionate full-stack developer in Germany. Just like art, where an artist would create wonderful arts with just a pencil and a piece of paper, so is programming. I can create wonderful and valuable tools that could potentially affect the lives of millions - positively - with just a computer, and a cup of koffee. This to me, is amazing!
